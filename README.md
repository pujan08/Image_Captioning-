# Image_Captioning-
What is Image Captioning ?

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. It uses both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate the captions.
This task lies at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. Most image captioning systems use an encoder-decoder framework, where an input image is encoded into an intermediate representation of the information in the image, and then decoded into a descriptive text sequence.
CNNs + RNNs (LSTMs)

To perform Image Captioning we will require two deep learning models combined into one for the training purpose
CNNs extract the features from the image of some vector size aka the vector embeddings. The size of these embeddings depend on the type of pretrained network being used for the feature extraction
LSTMs are used for the text generation process. The image embeddings are concatenated with the word embeddings and passed to the LSTM to generate the next word
